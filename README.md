# Your Task:

- Complete all TODOs within 
  - `main.cpp`
  - `train.cpp`
  - `railcar.cpp`

- Compile and run your program. See if it works as expected.

## Helpful Hints:
- Use `make` to compile your program.
- Look at the headers for the `train` and `railcar` classes.
- Look at main.cpp for the main function.
